Data attained from:

NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center)
- Unified Sea Ice Thickness Climate Data Record, 1947 Onward, Version 1 (G10006)
- DATA SET: G10006

https://nsidc.org/data/g10006/versions/1

<hr>

Modified the name of the original dataset to exclude the Version and YYYYMM to use them more easily in code.
<br>
There is no need to worry for any data loss by renaming these, because the version and YYYY-MM is already represented within each of the datasets. 
<br>
The 'distribution' of the attained data were removed, as the summaries contained specific data needed for the analysis.
